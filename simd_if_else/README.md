# SIMD if then else statement

With SIMD we can perform several floating point arithmetic operations
in one instruction. We can also do pseudo conditional execution with
SIMD even though it doesn't make sense to do multiple jumps at once.
We achieve this by doing a logical if-then-else similar to logic circuits.
